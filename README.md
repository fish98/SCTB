# Sound Christmas Tree written in Bash(SCTB)

GF wanted ttfish to prepare her with a digital Christmas tree since other girls, whose BFs are programmers, all have received various "trees" written in different programming languages recently. Thanks to [sergiolepore](git@github.com:sergiolepore/ChristBASHTree.git), ttfish was able to modify and finish this project for Christmas Eve on time. 

**MERRY CHRISTMAS TO ALL**
